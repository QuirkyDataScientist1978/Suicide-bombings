Smith died almost instantly, from the .32 caliber gun shot wounds.  The perpetrator fled on foot, but was later identified by eye-witnesses to be J.C. Simon.  Anthony C. Harris, witness for the prosecution during the trial, said that he was back at the car waiting for Simon and Manuel Moore to return, after he heard the gunshots. Both Simon and Moore were accused of the murders in trial. The perpetrators were black muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

The second device was described as a pressure cooker, which contained an explosive substance. The third device was contained in the bomber's backpack with screws, wires and an unknown explosive substance. Only the first device detonated. Witnesses said the bomber dropped something, possibly a cell phone, just before the blast, and after he stood up from picking it up, the belt device detonated. It is believed either the device that was dropped or the action of bending over triggered the device.
