"10/20/1973: Young white couple, Quita and Richard Hague, were taking an evening stroll on Telegraph Hill, just a block from their residence in San Francisco, California, in the United States, when they were approached by three African-American men in a white van, who ordered them into the van at gunpoint.  Upon entering the van, the couples hands were tied with rope, and Richard was clubbed into unconsciousness with a wrench, while one of the perpetrators sexually assaulted Quita.  Quita and Richard were both slashed brutally with a long machete-like blade.  Both were thrown out of the van on the rails of the Southern Pacific tracks, about four and a half miles from Telegraph Hill. Quita was killed by several slashes from the machete-like blade; Richard survived, but was badly mutilated by slashes in his face and he was robbed of his wallet. Two of the perpetrators, Jesse Cooks and Larry Green, were found, charged and in March 1976, convicted for the kidnapping, armed assault, robbery, and murder.  The third perpetrator, Anthony C. Harris, was given immunity at the trial in exchange for his testimony.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time. This was the first incident in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) by the perpetrators who came to be know as the Zebra killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217

As she sped up and reached her front door about to enter, the man approached her with a gun, forced her into a nearby dark parking lot, and raped her in the dirt area behind the bushes. During the incident, he told Linder that racism and oppression of black people needed to stop, and he threatened to kill her and told her that others would also be killed.   Then, he walked Linder home to make sure she would not call the police, and after talking more in her apartment, her raped her a second time in her bedroom. Linder survived and was eventually able to recover from the ordeal.

"12/22/1973: In the United States, white man, Neal Moynihan, was walking on Twelfth Street near the Civic Center, across the street from the Pacific Gas & Electric building, in San Francisco, California, just after 8pm, when he was approached by an African-American man, who shot Moynihan as they crossed paths, once in the face, and once each in the neck and chest.  A fourth shot missed Moynihan as he fell to the ground from the first three shots, and died instantly.  The perpetrator fled by foot on Gough Street, where he took the life of a white woman.  The only witness who was able to identify the killer was a night watchman for Pacific Gas & Electric, and his description of the perpetrator was later matched to Manuel Moore.  It was later discovered that the perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the ninth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"12/22/1973: In the United States, elderly white woman, Mildred Hosler, was on her way home from work, walking up Gough Street towards a Van Ness bus stop in San Francisco, California, to catch a bus to her home in Ellis, when she was shot five times in the upper body with .32 caliber bullets, by a man who was approaching her from across the street.  According to witnesses, Hosler saw her killer before he saw her, but she failed at trying to evade him, and was killed.  Witness descriptions of the perpetrator were matched to Larry Green.  Hosler was killed less than ten minutes after Neal Moynihan was killed on Twelfth Street.  It was later discovered that the perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the tenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"12/23/1973: In the United States, an unknown white, male body, wrapped in canvas and plastic, is found washed up on the beach at Pacheco Street and the Great Highway in San Francisco's Sunset district.  When the bloody and hacked body was retrieved, it was uncovered that the head was practically decapitated where the neck meets the shoulders and the extremities were also gone.  Only the torso was left, and the body was so badly beaten and tortured that it was unidentifiable, leading the police to name it ""Unknown Body #169.""  It was later discovered that this was the body of a man who had been kidnapped by the same black Muslims who committed the .32 caliber killings; the man was stripped naked, tied up, gagged, urinated on, and then subsequently mutilated with a collection of knives, machetes, meat cleavers, and metal cutters. The man's stomach was cut open, and he had been castrated.  This incident is believed to also be one of the Zebra murders, despite the fact that no indictments other than conspiracy charges were brought in this case.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

"01/28/1974: Elderly white man, John Bambic, who neighbors described as a loner, was rummaging through a trash bin on Ninth and Howard Streets in San Francisco, California, in the United States, when he was shot twice in the back by a black man, who fit the same description as the perpetrator of the murders of Tana Smith and Vincent Wollin.  The two .32 caliber gun shots hit Bambic once at the waist level, and once slightly higher up, hitting his heart.  The 84-year-old Bambic then grabbed the man who shot him in an attempt to fight back, until Bambic finally collapsed to his death on the ground.  The perpetrator, later identified by witnesses as J.C. Simon, ran across the street to a gas station where a Cadillac was waiting for him, with two other men inside.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the fourteenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers, and specifically, the third of 5 attacks on this day.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"1/28/1974:  White woman, Jane Holly, was doing her laundry at the Lightning Coin Launderette on Silver Avenue and Brussells Street in San Francisco, California in the United States.  As she was taking clothes out of the dryer, she was approached by a tall, black man who did not hesitate before he shot Holly two times in the back with a .32 caliber gun.  The perpetrators, who were later identified to be J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled without saying a word, and sped away in Moore's 1969 Cadillac, with Anthony Harris, who was waiting in the car and claims to have not seen the shooting.  Holly, the only white person in the laundromat at the time, died almost instantly from the bullets, one which hit her in the upper back, and the other in her abdomen.  Moore and Simon were charged with Holly's murder.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

"01/28/1974: In the United States, white man, Vincent Wollin was going about his daily business on his 69th birthday,  on Scott Street between Fulton and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, California, when he was approached by a man and shot twice in the back.  One of the .32 caliber bullets pierced through Wollin's heart, killing him almost instantly.  Wollin was just two blocks from his home.  This incident occurred just a few minutes after the murder of white woman Tana Smith a few streets away.  No indictment other than the charge of conspiracy was brought on this crime, but authorities believe that J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore were responsible for the murder of Wollin, as witness Anthony Harris described.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

"01/28/1974: White woman, Roxanne McMillian, was carrying the last of her moving boxes from her car to her new apartment in Excelsior at 102 Edinburgh in San Francisco, California, United States, when she was approached by a black man, who greeted her and said hello.  She responded with the same and then started up the stairs, at which point the man shot McMillian in the back two times with a .32 caliber gun; the first shot passed through her body, and the second hit her spine, paralyzing her from the waist down as she collapsed to the floor.  McMillian survived the attack, but was left paralyzed for the rest of her life.  She was the only one of the Zebra killers' five victims on this night in late January that survived.  The perpetrators, later identified as J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled to Moore's Cadillac, where Anthony Harris was waiting for them, and the three sped off.  Both Simon and Moore were accused of the assault in court.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

"01/28/1974: White woman, Tana Smith, was waiting at a bus stop at the corner of Geary Boulevard and Divisadero Street in San Francisco, California, United States, when she was approached by an African American man and shot two times in the back, from about fifteen feet away.  Smith died almost instantly, from the .32 caliber gun shot wounds.  The perpetrator fled on foot, but was later identified by eye-witnesses to be J.C. Simon.  Anthony C. Harris, witness for the prosecution during the trial, said that he was back at the car waiting for Simon and Manuel Moore to return, after he heard the gunshots.

As the two were walking up Geary Boulevard nearing Webster, they were passed by a black man, who then turned around and stopped, and then proceeded to shoot both cadets in their backs twice with his .32 caliber gun as they attempted to run.  The two bullets that hit Story, hit her in the waist (missing her spine), causing her to collapse to the ground, and resulting in the third bullet subsequently missing her altogether. Rainwater died, but Story survived the ordeal.  No nearby witnesses, nor Story, were able to identify the perpetrators, but police officers believe this was yet another attack by the Zebra killers.

Anderson asked the man if he had a cigarette, but he kept walking until he suddenly stopped, turned around, pulled out a gun and shot two .32 caliber bullets into Anderson.

"9/5/1975: Lynette Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a gun at President Gerald Ford as he walked to the California State Capitol Building in Sacramento, California, in the United States.  There were four bullets in the gun, but none in the firing chamber and Fromme was seized by two Secret Service agents immediately after brandishing her weapon.  Fromme maintained that she did not want to shoot the President and has given conflicting reports describing her motivations.  She has stated that she used the incident to bring attention to the unfair conviction of Charles Manson, and three others for the 1969 Tate-Labianca murders.  However, on other occasions Fromme stated that she pointed a gun at President Ford to raise the awareness of various environmental causes.",Reports of the motivations for this incident vary from bringing attention to the 'unfair' imprisonment of Charles Manson and his cohorts to trying to raise awareness of environmental issues such as the plight of the California Redwoods and the dangers of nuclear power.,1,Supporters of Charles Manson,217
