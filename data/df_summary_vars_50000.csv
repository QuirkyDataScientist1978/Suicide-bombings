"10/20/1973: Young white couple, Quita and Richard Hague, were taking an evening stroll on Telegraph Hill, just a block from their residence in San Francisco, California, in the United States, when they were approached by three African-American men in a white van, who ordered them into the van at gunpoint.  Upon entering the van, the couples hands were tied with rope, and Richard was clubbed into unconsciousness with a wrench, while one of the perpetrators sexually assaulted Quita.  Quita and Richard were both slashed brutally with a long machete-like blade.  Both were thrown out of the van on the rails of the Southern Pacific tracks, about four and a half miles from Telegraph Hill. Quita was killed by several slashes from the machete-like blade; Richard survived, but was badly mutilated by slashes in his face and he was robbed of his wallet. Two of the perpetrators, Jesse Cooks and Larry Green, were found, charged and in March 1976, convicted for the kidnapping, armed assault, robbery, and murder.  The third perpetrator, Anthony C. Harris, was given immunity at the trial in exchange for his testimony.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time. This was the first incident in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) by the perpetrators who came to be know as the Zebra killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217

As she sped up and reached her front door about to enter, the man approached her with a gun, forced her into a nearby dark parking lot, and raped her in the dirt area behind the bushes. During the incident, he told Linder that racism and oppression of black people needed to stop, and he threatened to kill her and told her that others would also be killed.   Then, he walked Linder home to make sure she would not call the police, and after talking more in her apartment, her raped her a second time in her bedroom. Linder survived and was eventually able to recover from the ordeal.

"12/22/1973: In the United States, white man, Neal Moynihan, was walking on Twelfth Street near the Civic Center, across the street from the Pacific Gas & Electric building, in San Francisco, California, just after 8pm, when he was approached by an African-American man, who shot Moynihan as they crossed paths, once in the face, and once each in the neck and chest.  A fourth shot missed Moynihan as he fell to the ground from the first three shots, and died instantly.  The perpetrator fled by foot on Gough Street, where he took the life of a white woman.  The only witness who was able to identify the killer was a night watchman for Pacific Gas & Electric, and his description of the perpetrator was later matched to Manuel Moore.  It was later discovered that the perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the ninth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"12/22/1973: In the United States, elderly white woman, Mildred Hosler, was on her way home from work, walking up Gough Street towards a Van Ness bus stop in San Francisco, California, to catch a bus to her home in Ellis, when she was shot five times in the upper body with .32 caliber bullets, by a man who was approaching her from across the street.  According to witnesses, Hosler saw her killer before he saw her, but she failed at trying to evade him, and was killed.  Witness descriptions of the perpetrator were matched to Larry Green.  Hosler was killed less than ten minutes after Neal Moynihan was killed on Twelfth Street.  It was later discovered that the perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the tenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"12/23/1973: In the United States, an unknown white, male body, wrapped in canvas and plastic, is found washed up on the beach at Pacheco Street and the Great Highway in San Francisco's Sunset district.  When the bloody and hacked body was retrieved, it was uncovered that the head was practically decapitated where the neck meets the shoulders and the extremities were also gone.  Only the torso was left, and the body was so badly beaten and tortured that it was unidentifiable, leading the police to name it ""Unknown Body #169.""  It was later discovered that this was the body of a man who had been kidnapped by the same black Muslims who committed the .32 caliber killings; the man was stripped naked, tied up, gagged, urinated on, and then subsequently mutilated with a collection of knives, machetes, meat cleavers, and metal cutters. The man's stomach was cut open, and he had been castrated.  This incident is believed to also be one of the Zebra murders, despite the fact that no indictments other than conspiracy charges were brought in this case.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

"01/28/1974: Elderly white man, John Bambic, who neighbors described as a loner, was rummaging through a trash bin on Ninth and Howard Streets in San Francisco, California, in the United States, when he was shot twice in the back by a black man, who fit the same description as the perpetrator of the murders of Tana Smith and Vincent Wollin.  The two .32 caliber gun shots hit Bambic once at the waist level, and once slightly higher up, hitting his heart.  The 84-year-old Bambic then grabbed the man who shot him in an attempt to fight back, until Bambic finally collapsed to his death on the ground.  The perpetrator, later identified by witnesses as J.C. Simon, ran across the street to a gas station where a Cadillac was waiting for him, with two other men inside.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.  This was the fourteenth in a series of 20 attacks (with 23 victims) on random whites by black Muslims who came to be known as the Zebra Killers, and specifically, the third of 5 attacks on this day.","While most law enforcement personnel involved in solving the Zebra murders agree that the killers were motivated by the goal of starting a race war, certain sources allege that the impetus for these attacks was based upon revenge for the illegitimate killing of Blacks, as well as upon the desire of personal promotion within both the ranks of the ""Death Angels"" (as indicated by the prosecution's main witness, Anthony Harris) and the eyes of Allah.",1,Zebra killers,217
"1/28/1974:  White woman, Jane Holly, was doing her laundry at the Lightning Coin Launderette on Silver Avenue and Brussells Street in San Francisco, California in the United States.  As she was taking clothes out of the dryer, she was approached by a tall, black man who did not hesitate before he shot Holly two times in the back with a .32 caliber gun.  The perpetrators, who were later identified to be J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled without saying a word, and sped away in Moore's 1969 Cadillac, with Anthony Harris, who was waiting in the car and claims to have not seen the shooting.  Holly, the only white person in the laundromat at the time, died almost instantly from the bullets, one which hit her in the upper back, and the other in her abdomen.  Moore and Simon were charged with Holly's murder.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.

"01/28/1974: In the United States, white man, Vincent Wollin was going about his daily business on his 69th birthday,  on Scott Street between Fulton and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, California, when he was approached by a man and shot twice in the back.  One of the .32 caliber bullets pierced through Wollin's heart, killing him almost instantly.  Wollin was just two blocks from his home.  This incident occurred just a few minutes after the murder of white woman Tana Smith a few streets away.  No indictment other than the charge of conspiracy was brought on this crime, but authorities believe that J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore were responsible for the murder of Wollin, as witness Anthony Harris described.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

"01/28/1974: White woman, Roxanne McMillian, was carrying the last of her moving boxes from her car to her new apartment in Excelsior at 102 Edinburgh in San Francisco, California, United States, when she was approached by a black man, who greeted her and said hello.  She responded with the same and then started up the stairs, at which point the man shot McMillian in the back two times with a .32 caliber gun; the first shot passed through her body, and the second hit her spine, paralyzing her from the waist down as she collapsed to the floor.  McMillian survived the attack, but was left paralyzed for the rest of her life.  She was the only one of the Zebra killers' five victims on this night in late January that survived.  The perpetrators, later identified as J.C. Simon and Manuel Moore, then fled to Moore's Cadillac, where Anthony Harris was waiting for them, and the three sped off.  Both Simon and Moore were accused of the assault in court.  The perpetrators were black Muslims who believed in the teachings of the Nation of Islam, and believed that they had to ""destroy the enemy"" and ""kill devils,"" which they translated into meaning, kill whites.  The motives were racist in origins and a response to the racial rhetoric of the time.

"01/28/1974: White woman, Tana Smith, was waiting at a bus stop at the corner of Geary Boulevard and Divisadero Street in San Francisco, California, United States, when she was approached by an African American man and shot two times in the back, from about fifteen feet away.  Smith died almost instantly, from the .32 caliber gun shot wounds.  The perpetrator fled on foot, but was later identified by eye-witnesses to be J.C. Simon.  Anthony C. Harris, witness for the prosecution during the trial, said that he was back at the car waiting for Simon and Manuel Moore to return, after he heard the gunshots.

As the two were walking up Geary Boulevard nearing Webster, they were passed by a black man, who then turned around and stopped, and then proceeded to shoot both cadets in their backs twice with his .32 caliber gun as they attempted to run.  The two bullets that hit Story, hit her in the waist (missing her spine), causing her to collapse to the ground, and resulting in the third bullet subsequently missing her altogether. Rainwater died, but Story survived the ordeal.  No nearby witnesses, nor Story, were able to identify the perpetrators, but police officers believe this was yet another attack by the Zebra killers.

Anderson asked the man if he had a cigarette, but he kept walking until he suddenly stopped, turned around, pulled out a gun and shot two .32 caliber bullets into Anderson.

"9/5/1975: Lynette Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, pointed a gun at President Gerald Ford as he walked to the California State Capitol Building in Sacramento, California, in the United States.  There were four bullets in the gun, but none in the firing chamber and Fromme was seized by two Secret Service agents immediately after brandishing her weapon.  Fromme maintained that she did not want to shoot the President and has given conflicting reports describing her motivations.  She has stated that she used the incident to bring attention to the unfair conviction of Charles Manson, and three others for the 1969 Tate-Labianca murders.  However, on other occasions Fromme stated that she pointed a gun at President Ford to raise the awareness of various environmental causes.",Reports of the motivations for this incident vary from bringing attention to the 'unfair' imprisonment of Charles Manson and his cohorts to trying to raise awareness of environmental issues such as the plight of the California Redwoods and the dangers of nuclear power.,1,Supporters of Charles Manson,217

They then took 30 people hostage and barricaded themselves in the kitchen of the hotel.  After negotiating with authorities, they released 12 hostages under the condition that the two shooters and the remaining hostages be allowed to travel to Larnaca Airport.  At the airport, the gunmen boarded a plane, along with 11 hostages and 4 volunteers from the flight crew.  Once in the air, the gunmen requested to land in Libya, Kuwait, Somalia, Greece and Sothern Yemen.  All 5 denied them permission to land.  The plane eventually landed in Djibouti and refueled.  After refueling the plane was forced to return to Larnaca Airport.  At the airport a gun fight erupted involving the Greek Cypriot National Guard and Egyptian commandos while both groups were attempting to rescue the hostages.  15 Egyptians were killed.  Eventually, the gunmen released all remaining hostages and surrender to the National Guard.

Cikoja was on his way to his own car, when he collapsed on the front stoop.  Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident because Cikoja had received a threat letter , three months prior to his murder, from a group calling itself the ""Croatian Nationalist Army"", demanding that he pay $5,000 by August towards the group's cause for independence, or otherwise he would be killed.

"11/18/1978: Leo Ryan, a California Democrat, was shot while trying to leave Jonestown with a group of unhappy sect members. Ryan had initially gone to Guyana to investigate abuses of members of the “Peoples’ Temple,” founded by Reverend Jim Jones. After being threatened with a knife by one of the members, Ryan decided to cut his visit short. As he was boarding an aircraft to leave, reports claim that between 8 and 12 members of the cult were responsible for firing approximately 50 shots. The shots killed three American investigators traveling with Jones, as well as an 18-year-old American woman who was trying to leave. Larry John Leyton, a man posing as a defector, was the only person charged in America for involvement in the murder. Jones organized the murder of Ryan and members of his party in order to keep them from revealing the true conditions at Jonestown.",Jones’ murder conspiracy was carried out in order to keep Ryan and those traveling with him from reporting the truth about conditions at Jonestown.,3,People's Temple,86

"12/15/1978: Black preacher, Manuel Whitfield of Columbus, Georgia, was abducted while hitchhiking on Interstate 65  in Cullman, Alabama, in the United States, by three white men in a van, who then dragged Whitfield into the woods and whipped and beat him, and then left him outside, a mile west of the highway. Whitfield survived and was treated for his wounds.  The Ku Klux Klan claimed responsibility for the attack and stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman.  Earlier this day, Whitfield preached for three hours on the steps of the Cullman County courthouse, at which time he denounced the conviction, and was taunted by whites. Whitfield initially refused to press charges against the perpetrators, but then later agreed to testify before a Federal grand jury.","The Ku Klux Klan  stated that Whitfield had no business being in Alabama and that the beating will teach him to stay out; the motive was that Whitfield had denounced the rape conviction of black man Tommy Lee Hines, for raping a white woman.",1,Ku Klux Klan,217

"02/26/1979: A bomb exploded outside of a parochial elementary school of the Sacred Heart Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, injuring a police officer who was attempting to dismantle the device.  The bomb was sent in a book, mailed to Reverend Timothy Majic, a Roman Catholic pastor of Sacred Heart Church, who also worked as an editor for the Morning Star, a Croatian-language newspaper published in Chicago. In the book, there were three batteries and what appeared to be dynamite in a hollowed out section.  While disarming the device, detective George Timm lost part of his right index finger, and suffered cuts on his hand, face, and chest. Croatian nationalists are suspected to be responsible for the incident.","The specific motive is unknown; however, it is suspected that the reason for the bomb was because the intended target, Timothy Majic, had been writing for a Croatian-language newspaper.",1,Croatian Nationalists,217

"05/17/1979: Two marines, Corporals Dennis E. Emerson and Amos L. Blythers were shot outside on the windward side of Oahu, Hawaii in the United States, by a group of non-white men whose motto was ""Save Hawaii for the Hawaiians.""   This incident was one in a series of attacks on the Navy and other military men in Hawaii over the previous five months.  Emerson was wounded and Blythers killed, after they were shot by .44 caliber pistols by three men, two of whom were captured by police.","The specific motive is unknown; however, this was one in a series of many attacks against US military servicemen in Hawaii by a band of non-whites whose motto was ""Save Hawaii for the Hawaiians."" Over the course of five months, four servicemen had been killed and at least 46 injured in what was believed to be a battle against military presence by this group of men who were seemingly attempting to prove their local machismo.",1,Hawaiian extremists,217

"05/26/1979: Members of the Ku Klux Klan, armed with guns, clubs, and sticks, disrupted a march of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Decatur, Alabama, United States.  The march was in support of a mentally disabled black man who was charged with raping a white woman, and convicted by an all-white jury.  During the march, Klansmen blocked the street, disobeyed police orders to allow the marchers to pass, and opened gunfire, injuring two black marchers and five law enforcements officials.  Two Klansmen were also shot and wounded. In May 1984, ten Klansmen were charged in federal court for civil rights violations in a violent disruption of black marchers and police, and nine of the men were charged with the conspiracy of use of force or threat of force for purposes of intimidating parade participants because of their race. By January 1989, all ten Klan members had either been found guilty or pleaded guilty to the charges brought against them in this incident.","The Klansmen intentionally intended to interrupt the march due to the fact that the marchers were protesting the conviction, by an all-white jury, of a mentally disabled black man for the rape of a white woman.",1,Ku Klux Klan,217

"12/04/1979: Jet [and] Cruise Travel Agency in Astoria, New York, in the United States, managed by Yugoslavian native, Nadjo Balac of Manhattan, was bombed by the Croatian Freedom Fighters, who claimed responsibility for the incident.  Two women, both employees of the agency, and an off-duty police officer, were slightly injured by shards of flying glass from the explosion.  Additionally, the explosion destroyed the side wall of the agency, causing extensive damage, and also damaged a jewelry store on the first floor and the apartment of an elderly couple on the third floor.  Less than an hour after the blast, a man called the Associated Press and a local TV station, claiming bombing and identifying himself as a member of the Croatian Freedom Fighters.  He also stated that a message was left in a locker at the terminal at 421 Grand Central Station.  The message was written in Croatian and listed a series of demands that the group asked be aired on television and radio between 6pm and 7pm that evening, otherwise 2 more bombs, which were placed in congested areas, would be detonated at 8:30pm that evening. The group's message, which denounced  the Yugoslav Secret Police, and asked that the U.S. stop economic aid to Yugoslavia  and that political and economic ties to Yugoslavia by the U.S. and West Germany be broken, was aired, and no other bombs were detonated.","Croatian nationalists were seeking independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia, and wanted the U.S. and West Germany to stop providing economic aid and to break all political and economic ties with Yugoslavia.",1,Croatian Freedom Fighters,217

"2/20/1980: Eight members of the May 19 Communist Order attempted to rob an armored truck stationed outside of Korvettes Department Store in Greenburgh, New York, United States.  However, a security guard refused to open up the truck even as the perpetrators threatened to kill another guard they were holding hostage.  The perpetrators eventually fled from the scene without stealing any money. No casualties resulted from the incident.","The May 19 Communist Order consisted of Revolutionary Leftists attempting to ""expropriate"" funds from the establishment in order to improve to the conditions of the poor.  The armed robberies were viewed as a way to procure weapons and safe houses that would be used in the armed struggle against those in power.",1,May 19 Communist Order,217

"02/21/1980: In the United States, unknown perpetrator(s) fired a shot through the window of the building housing the Soviet Mission to the UN in New York City, which was the intended target of the shot.  The .38 caliber bullet went through the window of an apartment housing a family of three, where a woman and seven year-old child were lucky to be missed by the bullet, which eventually hit a venetian blind and then fell to the floor.  No one was injured in the incident, but the window was shattered. The Tass news agency claimed the bullet was a link in the anti-Soviet campaign taking place in the US, and the agency denounced US authorities for inadequately safeguarding the Soviet Mission and its staff, despite repeated requests by the USSR.",Unknown,1,Unknown,217

"03/12/1980: The Macheteros, a group advocating for the independence of Puerto Rico, claimed responsibility in a letter to a San Juan newspaper, for an ambush against a government vehicle carrying three US Army ROTC officers who were on their way to teach at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The ambush left one serviceman slightly injured by broken glass which lightly grazed him.  The vehicle, which had no government markings, had just left the Las Americas expressway at an exit about one mile from the University of Puerto Rico, where three to four men were hiding under an underpass.  One perpetrator jumped out and opened fire on the government vehicle with a rifle, leaving 11 bullet holes in the vehicle.  This was the second attack against US military personnel in Puerto Rico in four months but it is unclear whether this attack was linked to the December attack of a Navy Bus as that incident was claimed by three different Puerto Rican nationalist groups.",The group advocated for the independence of Puerto Rico,1,Macheteros,217

"04/19/1980: Two white men fired shots from a shotgun into a mobile home while driving by, in Wrightsville, Georgia, United States, wounding nine-year-old black girl, Constance Folsom, in the forehead, neck, and chin.  The girl was in satisfactory condition and treated for her wounds.  It is unknown whether any property damage occurred. This incident occurred a few hours after a demonstration protesting the treatment of blacks in the racially divided community.  For several weeks prior to the incident, there had been unrest in the community between whites and blacks, with blacks protesting against racial, economic, and political injustices against them, asking for better jobs and representation in local government.  The perpetrators, Herschel Hall and Danny Foskey, were arrested and charged with aggravated assault. It is uncertain whether the two are members of the Ku Klux Klan.","The specific motive is unknown; however, This incident occurred a few hours after a demonstration protesting the treatment of blacks in the racially divided community.

"04/19/1980: Three Ku Klux Klansmen, shot four black women, who were standing in crowd on a downtown street corner in predominantly black community in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States.  The Klansmen, William Church (imperial wizard of the Justice Knights of the Ku Klux Klan), Larry Payne, and Marshall Thrash, fired the shots from a shotgun, while driving by in a car shortly after setting two wooden crosses on fire just a few blocks away.  The women were wounded, but all treated for their injuries and survived.  This incident occurred during a time of racial tensions in the community.  All three Klansmen were brought to trial on four counts of assault with intent to commit murder; Church and Payne were acquitted by an all-white jury, and Thrash was convicted of the shooting and sentenced to 20 months in prison and a fine.",The perpetrators say they intended for the shots to call attention to the burning crosses a few blacks away; the incident occurred during a time of racial tensions.,1,Ku Klux Klan,217

"08/04/1980: Eight white men, who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, opened shotgun fire on a black man, George Lester Stewart, while he was standing in a parking lot outside a west side bar in Detroit, Michigan in the United States.  Stewart frequented the tavern which had a mostly white clientele and a white bartender, and the eight perpetrators conspired, prior to the incident,  to kill Stewart because of his race, and had even threatened him the month prior to the attack.  After the attack in the parking lot failed to injure him, the perpetrators attempted to shoot him with automatic rifles at his residence and altogether fired 27 shots.  Neither Stewart, nor any other individuals were wounded in either attack. Charles Furtaw, Donald Johnson, Raymond Eugene Echlin, Eugene John, Walter Belcher, Richard Johnson, Ronald Bishop, and Joseph Greenwell were the eight arrested and charged in the attack, and four of them pleaded guilty in court.",Racially motivated crime; target was black and frequented a majority white tavern,1,Ku Klux Klan,217

"10/02/1980: Three white teenagers firebombed the home of a black family in a predominantly white neighborhood in Manchester, Connecticut, United States.   The molotov cocktail was thrown through a bedroom window of the home of Bruce Meggett and Lucinda Harris, who were not home at the time of the incident.  Four children, ranging in ages from 6 years old to 15 years old, and their uncle were in the home when the lighted gasoline firebomb bounced off of the arm of the 6-year old girl and exploded, setting the home on fire.  No one was injured in the incident, but the fire caused $7,800 in damages to the home.  Though authorities believe that this incident had no involvement from the Ku Klux Klan, it occurred three weeks after the  Klan held its first public rally in the state in more than 70 years.  However, the bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights. Charles N. Metheny and Eugene R. Gilliland were arrested and indicted for the arson, and a third suspect was being sought by police.","The bombing was intended to intimidate the family and other black families in the area, and infringe upon the family's housing rights.

"10/14/1980: Eugene A. Tafoya entered the home of Faisal A. Zagallai in Fort Collins, Colorado in the United States, and shot him twice in the head.  Zagallai, a doctoral student at Colorado State University, survived the attack but lost vision in one eye.  It is believed that Tafoya was hired by rogue CIA agent Edwin P. Wilson to carry out the shooting on behalf of the Libyan government.  Zagallai was a harsh critic of Libyan ruler Muammar Qaddafi and was a leader of anti-Qaddafi dissidents in the United States at the time.",To silence dissidents of the Muammar Qaddafi regime,1,Gaddafi loyalists,217

"11/01/1980:  Black girl, Veronica Vaughan, was shot and killed by three white youths in a pickup truck, driving behind her, as she was walking home from a party with a friend. Vaughan was shot just three blocks from her parents home, where she lived in Youngstown, Ohio in the United States.  The perpetrators, all three of whom were arrested and charged for Vaughan's murder, stated that they wanted to attack Black people out of revenge for being jumped by a group of Blacks previously.  However, they shot Blacks at random, not specifically the people who attacked them.  This attack occurred at a time when racial tensions were volatile in Youngstown, and violence against blacks across the nation in general was increasing, as was activity by the Ku Klux Klan, which lead to the perception of a conspiracy against blacks.  This attack caused hysteria within the Black community.","The perpetrators stated that they wanted to attack Black people out of revenge for being jumped by a group of Blacks previously.

"02/13/1981: Three members of the Ku Klux Klan, Timothy Wayne Snider and Richard Lee Roberts and one unidentified man, kidnapped a former KKK chaplain William Seward from his home and forced him into their van, hand cuffed him, and held Seward at gun point for a two hour ride to east Memphis in Tennessee, United States, before leaving him near a hotel after they poured yellow paint on him and feathered  him.  Seward stated that the men attempted to collect debts they believed he owed them after accusing Seward of being a government agent and traitor.  The men cut Seward's hair, and threatened his life and the lives of his family members, and told him they knew where he ""cashed his government paycheck,"" all of which was untrue.  Timothy Wayne Snider and Richard Lee Roberts were arrested and charged with kidnapping.  One day prior to the incident, a Klansman called the Commercial Appeal newspaper and stated that a traitor to the Klan would be disciplined the next day, and then after the incident, another call came through notifying that the deed was done and the man could be found near the east Memphis area, where Seward was released.",Intimidation of target and those who decide to go against the KKK or help the government; an issue of inner-party conflict.,1,Ku Klux Klan,217

No casualties resulted in the incident, but the blasts caused minor damage.  Prior to the bombing, the owner of the store, an Armenian American, had received an extortion letter from the Armenian Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), demanding a $150,000 contribution and stating that the money would help finance the group's cause of liberating their enslaved land and giving their people its national honor and dignity.

The women said the arson was a protest against the use of herbicides, and claimed responsibility for the incident in phone calls to various news organizations, including Coast News Service, as well as in a written statement left at the Newport Post Office.  The fire caused $180,000 in damages (the total cost of the aircraft).

The forty-four policemen on duty offered no resistence when the first team fired two shots, killing one constable and four of Ziar’s defenders, and accidentally wounding two of their own men. When inside, Lt-Col Matiur Rahman [Mahbubur], a Freedom Fighter, shot and killed General Ziaur.","The attempted coup was staged by Bangledeshi rebel army officers who were supporters of the Awami League and veterans of the Mukti Bahini [1971 Freedom Fighters].

"06/25/1981: In Torrance, California, United States, a firebomb exploded outside the building used by the Institute for Historical Review (IHR), a group that denied the Holocaust ever occurred, claiming there is no proof that the Nazis gassed Jews during World War II.  There was minor damage to the building, and no casualties resulted from the incident.  About two hours before the blast, an anonymous caller told the Associated Press, United Press International, and the City News Service, in Los Angeles, that a bomb had been planted by a group named the Jewish Defenders.  Police then confirmed the bombing, but it was unclear whether the IHR still used the building at the time.","The Institute for Historical Review was a revisionist organization hat denied the occurrence of the Holocaust and the actions of the Nazis during WWII, stating that there was no proof that the atrocities occurred.",1,Jewish Defenders,217

The bomb was lodged outside the College Park municipal building underneath the air conditioner on the ground, but authorities had no reason to believe the bomb was meant for city government officials, and thus, it is suspected that the bomb was specifically aimed at the students because they were Chinese; however, the perpetrators and exact motives are unknown.  The bomb caused $100,000 worth of damage to the municipal building and shattered windows in cars and establishments within a 250-foot radius.",The specific motive is unknown; but it is suspected that the reason for the bombing was because the targets were Chinese,1,Unknown,217

No casualties resulted from the incident.  The Black Brigade claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the Washington Post after the incident, and left a letter at the rear of the chancery noting that the attack was in response to the execution of five members of Liberia's ruling People's Redemption Council, who were also political opponents of Liberia's military leader.","The attack was in response to the execution of five members of Liberia's ruling People's Redemption Council, who were also political opponents of Liberia's military leader.",1,Black Brigade (United States),217

"08/27/1981: Two bombs exploded at an electric substation outside of the Isla Verde International Airport in Laguna Gardens, Puerto Rico, a suburb of San Juan and Carolina.  The explosions caused $30,000 in damages and left hundreds of residents in Laguna Gardens without power for two hours. There were no casualties. Two additional bombs were also found, but did not detonate due to damage of critical components of the devices caused by the first two explosions, and the bombs were subsequently deactivated by authorities.  In a call to a San Juan radio station, Grupo Estrella claimed responsibility for the blasts, which coincided with a nine-day strike by 6,700 power authority workers against the Puerto Rican Electric and Power Authority, in demand of higher wages.","The specific motive is unknown; however, the bombing coincided with a nine-day strike of 6,700 hourly power authority workers against the Puerto Rican Electric and Power Authority, in demand for higher wages.",1,Grupo Estrella,217

"05/27/1982: A molotov cocktail was thrown and exploded at the front door of the Northridge home of Dr. George Ashley in San Fernando Valley, just 24 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California, United States. Dr. Ashley was a high school teacher in the Sun Valley area of L.A. and an advisor at the Institute for Historical Review, a private research organization in Torrance, California, which has maintained that the Holocaust never occurred. No one was injured in the incident, but the blast  caused about $1,000 in property damage.  The perpetrators are unknown, but are suspected to be Jewish.  A call was made to the Associated Press after the incident but much of it was incomprehensible; however, past calls claiming responsibility for attacks on Ashley's home were made in the name of ""Jewish Defenders."" Additionally, before the explosion, Ashley had received warning calls stating ""We will burn you alive with your family and give you a good Jewish lesson.""","Ashley had argued that accounts of Nazi genocide against Jews during World War II are exaggerated, and he worked the Institute for Historical Review, an organization that believed that the Holocaust never occurred.",1,Jewish Extremists,217

"01/21/1983: Unknown perpetrators planted nine bombs at the Golden Jack Bakery, a Middle Eastern bakery, which sells Armenian and Lebanese breads, in Anaheim, California, United States.  Authorities discovered the pipe bombs, which were made of highly volatile, smokeless powder and  strung together with wires, when they were called to a fire at the bakery, which was set off by a battery-powered device. It is suspected that the arson and the bombs were linked.  All of the bombs were removed and deactivated, and there were no injuries in this incident, but the extent of property damage from the fire is unknown.",Unknown,1,Unknown,217

"02/15/1983: Armed with a 9mm submachine automatic rifle and possibly a bomb, Iranian immigrant, Hussein Shey Kholya, hijacked Rio Airways Flight 252 about halfway through the one hour flight from Killeen, Texas, en route to Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport in Dallas, Texas.  During the incident, Kholya held hostage the 21 other passengers and crew members on the plane, and only released them after diverting the plane to land in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, once Kholya made a deal with Mexican officials for a plane ticket to Cuba in exchange for the release of the passengers.  All the hostages were released unharmed.  Kholya's motivation for hijacking the plane was because he was opposed to U.S. policy towards Iran and he wanted to make Americans aware of the conditions in Iran.",To protest United States policy towards Iran.,1,Iranian extremists,217

"07/28/1983: The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama, United States was set ablaze by unknown arsonist(s) in the early morning hours, causing damage to walls, doors, carpets, equipment, case files and books in the library.  The arson was set by using a petroleum-based liquid mixed with motor oil or diesel fuel, and though the perpetrators are unknown, the Ku Klux Klan is suspected to be responsible for the attack as the Center had several legal cases pending against the KK and the organization is home to Klanwatch, a group that monitors activities of the KKK, educates the public and leads litigation.  Additionally, the arson was set specifically to the office of the director of Klanwatch, Randall Williams.  There were no injuries in the incident.","Uncertain; however, it is suspected that the KKK was responsible for the arson because the Southern Poverty Law Center was home to Klanwatch, a group that monitored activities of the KKK, and the Center also had several legal cases pending against the KKK in federal courts.",1,Ku Klux Klan,217

"07/29/1983: Three bombs exploded at the downtown Hotel Rajneesh, owned by followers of Indian guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, in Portland, Oregon, United States.  The explosions caused an estimated $180,000 in damages to the four-story hotel and its contents, and seriously injured one of three perpetrators, Stephen Paster, who suffered injuries to both hands, both arms, his face and torso from the first bomb.  The second and third explosions caused minor injury to a police officer on the scene who was treated for smoke inhalation.  Paster, who was not part of the Rajneeshee sect, was charged and convicted of arson and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Authorities suspected that he was part of a Muslim sect, and the incident has been attributed to Jamaat-al-Fuqra by sources, but this is unclear.  Police were also searching for two other perpetrators who were believed to also be responsible for the incident.",The specific motive is unknown; but the Rajneeshee group was not received well from the beginning of its presence in the US from India and the teachings of the sect stirred controversy; their request for permanent residency in the United States was met with much resistance.,1,Jamaat-al-Fuqra,217

"08/09/1983: In Springfield, Missouri, United States, the Metropolitan Community Church, which had a homosexual congregation, was set on fire by the white supremacist group, the Covenant, Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA). No casualties resulted from the incident, and the damage was minimal, but included the charring of the front door.  The perpetrators were identified as James D. Ellison, who was also the founder of CSA, and was eventually convicted and sentenced for the crime, and a former CSA member, William Thomas, who actually placed the gallon can of gasoline into the mail slot of the front door of the church, and ignited it.","To terrorize minority groups, start a holy war, ultimately overthrow the government, which the CSA believed to be run by a Zionist occupation",1,"Covenant, Sword and the Arm of the Lord (CSA)",217
"08/09/1983:  An arson was set at the center of the Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam (AMI) in Detroit, Michigan, United States, which resulted in the death of the two suspected perpetrators, William Augustus Cain and Calvin Stanley Jones.  Authorities suspect that the two set the fire, and then were trapped by their own arson when the rear door of the building failed to open, thus causing the men to die of smoke inhalation.  When the fire was extinguished, the two bodies were found, along with two semi-automatic handguns, one of which was positively identified as the weapon used to assassinate AMI Secretary Dr. Mozaffar Ahmed on December 8.",Unknown,1,Unknown,217

"10/30/1983: The U.S. Federal Building, housing the FBI headquarters in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, was blasted with a bazooka.  Specifically, it was a light anti-tank weapon which was made for use by the U.S. Army.  No casualties resulted from the attack; however, the blast caused shattered windows and frames, and damage to air conditioners and ceiling as well as minor damage to the U.S. Department of Agriculture nearby. There were at least three perpetrators in the attack. The Macheteros claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to the Associated Press in San Juan, at which time the caller expressed the group's support for the people of Grenada and opposition towards the US for the invasion of Grenada. Additionally, the group left communiqués which stated the blast was in protest of the policies of the U.S. and Ronald Reagan, who the Macheteros claim, took advantage of the people of Grenada to reestablish imperialism.","To show opposition towards the US for the invasion of Grenada and to protest of the policies of the U.S. and Ronald Reagan, who the Macheteros claim, took advantage of the people of Grenada to reestablish imperialism.",1,Macheteros,217

"01/30/1984: Two members of The Order (Silent Brotherhood), Bruce Carroll Pierce and Gary Lee Yarbrough, robbed the Washington Mutual Savings Bank at East Sprague Avenue in Spokane, Washington, United States.  In an attempt to divert authorities, they also placed a brown package containing a fake bomb at the Two Swabbies clothing outlet store nearby, and from the Mr. Steak restaurant near the bank, made a warning phone call about the fake bomb to police. At the bank, they handed the teller a note requesting money, which netted them $3,600 from the robbery, of which, $200 was sent to Bob Miles, a racist leader in Michigan, and another $100 given to the Aryan Nation group.  There were no casualties in the incident.","The money was used to finance a race war and revolution against the U.S. government; some of the money was sent to a racial leader and some to another white supremacist group, the Aryan Nation.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

Then, another member of The Order, made a warning phone call to the cashier at the theater, but before any precautions could be taken, the bomb exploded, leaving minimal damage, destroying about 10 seats in the theater, and no casualties.  The motive for the bombing was twofold: first, to spread the group's message that pornography was intolerable and second, to act as a diversion for the group's planned armored car robbery the next day (907).","The motive was twofold: first, to send the message that pornography would not be tolerated, and second to use the bombing as a diversionary tactic in order to carry out the group's armored car robbery the next day.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

"04/23/1984: Seven members of The Order, Bruce Carroll Pierce, Robert Mathews, Gary Lee Yarbrough, Randolph Duey, Denver Parmenter, Andrew Virgil Barnhill, and Richard Kemp, robbed Continental Armored Transport truck employee, George King, at the Northgate Mall in Seattle, Washington, United States.  Using his car, Parmenter pinned the armored truck into a corner, while Pierce and Duey posed as window washers between an office supply store and a store called Bon Marche, concealing their weapons.  As George King was returning to the money compartment of the truck from Bon Marche, Pierce and Duey pulled their guns on King and the truck driver, Robert White, demanding they surrender their guns and get out of the truck or die.  At this point, Yarbrough pulled alongside with Mathews in their van, and Barnhill got out of the Chrysler he was driving, and also brandished a gun. Kemp was also at the scene with a shotgun, and the armored truck employees were forced to the back of the truck, while the perpetrators stole about $536,000 in cash and checks combined, $301,334 of which was in checks and subsequently burned.  One shot was fired during the attack, but no one was hit and there were no casualties.","The money was used to finance the groups operations towards a revolution against the US government, which they believed to be occupied by Zionists; the money was used as incentive for new recruits, a printing press for counterfeiting scams, computers to access Aryan Nation literature, and firearms; additionally, some money was used to fund their race war via donation to the Aryan Nation.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

The bomb, which was homemade by Pierce and consisted of three sticks of dynamite, an electric blasting cap, a battery, and a timer, caused minor damage to the synagogue's kitchen and heating equipment, in the amount of $4,000.  No casualties resulted from the blast, which Pierce later described as an ""act of war"" to serve ""the greater good,"" even though he initially intended the bombing to be a test of his homemade device.  However, the bombing occurred at the start of a week-long national convention to commemorate victims of the Holocaust.","Even though the perpetrators wanted to test their homemade explosive device, they chose a synagogue because they were anti-Semitic, and wanted to eliminate Jews; additionally, they considered this a progression in their race and anti-US government war.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

"06/18/1974: Prominent and controversial Jewish radio talk-show host who was an outspoken opponent of racism, Alan Berg, was murdered by members of The Order outside his residence at 1445 Adams Street in Denver, Colorado, United States.  After following and watching Berg's actions for a few hours on the night of his murder, at about 9:21pm, Robert Mathews, David Lane, and Bruce Carroll Pierce, watched Alan Berg pull into his driveway, at which point Pierce came up to Berg as he was exiting his Volkswagen Beetle, and shot him thirteen times point-blank in the head and body with a .45 caliber cartridges from a automatic Ingram MAC-10 machine gun.  Berg suffered about thirty-four wounds, and died instantly.  Four members of the group were indicted for his murder under the charges of violating Berg's civil rights: David Lane, Bruce Carroll Pierce, Jean Margaret Craig, who helped to gather information in an intelligence folder on Berg's life and whereabouts for about three weeks before his murder, and Richard Scutari, who helped to devise the plan of action for the murder.  Only Lane and Pierce were convicted and sentenced for the crime.","Berg was known for his largely liberal opinions on a variety of controversial issues, and was a stark opponent of racism and anti-Semitism.  He had a slightly combative and blunt style that insulted many conservatives as well as the callers and guests on his show.   On one of his shows, Berg humiliated Klansman and member of The Aryan Nation, David Lane, who was eventually one of his murderers, by calling him a ""sick and pathetic human being."" Berg also berated other media figures on his show, such as the publisher of a paper which ran an anti-Jewish series, the writer of which, shared an apartment with Lane for a short time.  Also, Berg was Jewish, and the group wanted to eliminate Jews.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

"07/19/1984: Twelve members of The Order took part in the robbery of a Brinks armored car, on California Highway 20, between U.S. Highway 101 and Lake Mendocino outside of Ukiah, California, in the United States, shortly after noon.  In the midst of the robbery, the perpetrators, all but one, wearing bandannas over their faces, and one dressed in disguise as a woman, used a variety of firearms to stop the Brinks truck and its drivers and steal $3.6 million.  During the event, one perpetrator held up a note, reading ""Get out or die"" (similar to the note used in the April 23 armored truck robbery in Seattle, Washington).  Even though shots were fired, there were no injuries or casualties from the robbery.  However, the tires of the Brinks truck were shot flat to stop it.  Eventually, ten people were charged with the robbery.","The Order (Silent Brotherhood) was a white supremacist group that was anti-government, against Jews and other minorities, and sought to start a race war and overthrow the government.  In particular, they used the robbery money to finance their revolution by buying equipment, literature, and as incentive for recruits for their cause, as well as to secure loyalty from members. The money from this robbery in particular was also donated to Identity preachers, KKK members, other neo-Nazis, the White Aryan Resistance, a racist college professor, and used to establish a surrogate mother program to support a sperm bank for the future of Aryan warriors.",1,The Order (Silent Brotherhood),217

"01/25/1985:  A light antitank weapon, namely a bazooka rocket, was fired at the United States Courthouse in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, striking the back of the fourth floor of the courthouse building.  No casualties resulted from the incident, but the attack caused damage to a wall of the building as well as shattered a window.  Both Los Macheteros and the Organization of Volunteers for the Puerto Rican Revolution were responsible for the attack, which they claimed in a joint communiqué five days later, stating that the attack was in memory of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary, Juan Antonio Corretjer, who had died the week earlier, but as a poet and advocate of Puerto Rican Independence, he spent much of his life fighting against ""Yankee Imperialism.""","The attack was meant to be in memory of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary, Juan Antonio Corretjer, who had died the week earlier, but as a poet and advocate of Puerto Rican Independence, he spent much of his life fighting against ""Yankee Imperialism.""

I have decided to fulfill my duty toward the south."" A party official claimed that the suicide was Sana's own idea.","The perpetrator's letter read ""Do not be sad for me, the south must be liberated.""",10,Syrian Social Nationalist Party,110

"05/15/1985: A pipe bomb exploded outside the front door of the Northridge home of Dr. George Ashley in San Fernando Valley, just 24 miles northwest of Los Angeles, California, United States. Dr. Ashley was a former high school teacher and an advisor at the Institute for Historical Review, a private research organization in Torrance, California, which has maintained that the Holocaust never occurred. No one was injured in the incident, but the blast destroyed the front door and caused about $1,000 in property damage.  Prior to the explosion, the sidewalk outside the home had been spray-painted with the letters ""JDL.""  Though no one claimed credit for the bombing and the Jewish Defense League (JDL) actually denied responsibility, authorities believe it was the action of the JDL, as Ashley's house had been previously broken into and vandalized with slogans saying ""Never Again"" and ""No More Holocaust.""","Ashley had argued that accounts of Nazi genocide against Jews during World War II are exaggerated, and he worked the Institute for Historical Review, an organization that believed that the Holocaust never occurred.",1,Jewish Defense League (JDL),217

"06/02/1985: The east side home of a black family in the Slavic neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, United States, was firebombed by an explosive that was thrown through a window of the home, resulting in the death of elderly black woman, Mabel Gant, who burned to death as she was trapped in her first floor bedroom during the fire.  Two white teenagers from the neighborhood were arrested as suspects and authorities were searching for additional suspects.  The Gant family was one of few black families in the white Polish neighborhood, and authorities confirmed that the gasoline bombing was racially motivated. This was one of several in a wave of racially motivated incidents in the area as well as other states at the time.",Racially motivated; the Gant family was one of only a few black families in a predominantly white neighborhood,1,White extremists,217

"06/22/1985: Two bombs exploded in the Moslem prayer room at the Daar Us Salaam mosque in Houston, Texas, United States, about an hour after worshippers left the mosque.  There were no casualties in the incident, but the explosions caused about $50,000 in damages.  Daniel Allen Russell, Randy James Jones, and Stephen C. Ahern, all of Houston, were all charged and sentenced after their admissions to constructing and planting the bombs in the mosque.  It appears that the perpetrators acted independently of any group, and their reasons for the bombing, while conflicting, are suspected to be in retaliation and anger over American hostages being held in Lebanon during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of passengers aboard TWA Flight 847.  The bombing came in the midst of threatening phone calls to several area mosques and Islamic society headquarters after the hostage situation in Beirut.","Though there is conflicting information, the motive seems to be that the perpetrators were angry and retaliating for the holding of American hostages in Beirut during the Shiite Moslem hijacking of TWA Flight 847.",1,Anti-Muslim extremists,217

"09/06/1985: A bomb exploded at the home of Elmars Sprogis in Brentwood, New York, United States, a residential community in Suffolk County, about 40 miles east of Manhattan.  Sprogis, and American citizen, was a former police chief in Nazi-occupied Latvia during World War II, and had been previously been accused of war crimes, but in deportation proceedings, all charges against him were dismissed.  At the time of the incident, it is suspected that a fire was set at Sprogis' home in order to have him evacuate the home via the front door, where an explosive was planted on his front steps.  Sprogis' neighbor Robert Seifried, saw the fire, and went to alert Sprogis, but inadvertently set off the bomb (meant for Sprogis), resulting in serious burns to his Seifried's right foot, leg and shoulder.  Damage to the home included shattered windows, destroyed aluminum siding, and other minor damage.  After the incident, two calls were made to Newsday newspaper from an unknown male, stating ""Listen carefully, Jewish Defense League, Nazi war criminal. Bomb. Never again.""  Though the JDL denied involvement in the incident, authorities believe the group was responsible.","Elmars Sprogis was a former police chief in Nazi occupied Latvia during WWII and was accused of war crimes against Jews; the FBI brought a deportation case against him years prior, but all charges were dismissed due to lack of evidence.  Members of the JDL and other militant Jewish organizations were critical of the decision.",1,Jewish Defense League (JDL),217

"08/07/1986: A 12-inch pipe bomb exploded at Fred Bower's Classic Auto Restoration auto-repair shop in Hayden, Idaho, United States, causing about $2000 in damages.  No casualties resulted from the incident.  The perpetrators, David and Deborah Dorr, and suspected perpetrator Edward W. Hawley, were members of The Order II (also known as Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II) which was a group formed by David Dorr to continue to carry out the white supremacist mission of The Order, which collapsed after the group members were captured.  The Order II (like the first one) was also a splinter group of the Aryan Nation.","The specific motive is unclear; however, The Order II was a group that arose after The Order collapsed, and the group was started by David Dorr, a former Aryan Nation member.  The group included other Aryan Nations members and its goal was to carry out the white supremacist mission of the first version of The Order. The Order II was also against the government, which the group believed was unrighteous.",1,The Order II (Bruder Schweigen Strike Force II),217

"04/16/1987: A fire set to the animal diagnostic center at the Veterinary Medicine Research Building at the University of California-Davis, in the United States, partially destroyed the building, causing an estimated $3,500,000 in damages. Additionally, vandals slashed tires and painted slogans such as ""Animal Liberation Front"" and ""Stop the Torture,"" on about seventeen parked cars including university vehicles, in lots on the campus, about a half-mile from the fire. There were no casualties in the incident.  Hand-printed notes, signed ""ALF,"" for Animal Liberation Front, claimed the vandalism of vehicles was ""to retaliate in the name of thousands of animals tortured each year in campus labs."" The notes were slipped under the front door of a building in Sacramento housing offices of both The Associated Press and United Press International.  Additionally, in an anonymous telephone call made to a Sacramento television station after the fire, the caller stated that ALF was responsible for the arson as well.","To protest the ""torture"" of thousands of animals in campus labs each year.",1,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),217

"10/05/1987:  Members of a group calling itself the ""Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy"" (EMETIC), claimed responsibility for using an acetylene torch to cut through support bolts in twelve pylons connected to cables which held the main ski chairlift at the Fairfield Snow Bowl Ski Resort in Flagstaff, Arizona in the United States.  The propane torches were used to cut the polls along the newest chairlift at Agassiz Peak, and additionally, the perpetrators smashed windows at the terminal stations at the top of the lift as well as at a building used by ski patrol in the winter.  There were no casualties, but the property damage was estimated at $100,000. In a letter to local media outlets after the incident, the group stated more sabotage would follow.  Marc Leslie Davis and Margaret Katherine Millet, were arrested and in 1991, pled guilty and sentenced for their involvement in this incident.","The mountain peaks on which the ski resort sat, were considered sacred to the Navajo and Hopi Indian tribes, and the perpetrators criticized the US Forest Service for allowing the ski area to be built there back in the 1970s.",1,Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy (EMETIC),217

The hijackers rerouted the plane and its 112 passengers and crew to Mashad, Iran, then onto Cyprus, where two of the passengers were killed.  On April 13, 1998, the hijackers rerouted the plane again to Algiers.  The hijackers demanded the release of 17 convicted Arab bombers who were being held in Kuwaiti prisons.  Kuwait refused to meet the hijackers' demand; despite this, the hostages were released in Algiers on April 20, 1998.

"11/11/1988: Animal rights activist, Fran Stephanie Trutt, placed a  13-inch, nail studded and radio-controlled pipe bomb outside the United States Surgical Corporation in Norwalk, Connecticut in the United States.  The bomb was placed under bushes near an executive doorway and a parking space used by the founder and chairman of the corporation, Leon Hirsch, and the device(according to Trutt) was intended to scare Hirsch into stopping the company's use of live dogs in research and in testing its surgical stapling products on the animals.  Trutt was arrested at the time she planted the bomb, but was intending to wait until 8am to detonate the bomb when Hirsch arrived to work.  The bomb later detonated when police attempted to dismantle it at another location after the device was seized.  Trutt was eventually charged, pleaded no-contest, and was sentenced to one year in prison followed by three years of probation for the attempted murder.",To protest the testing of surgical stapling products on live dogs and frighten the company chairman into halting this practice.,1,Animal Rights extremists,217

"01/29/1989: Suspected members of Earth First! claimed to have set fire to the Dixon Livestock Auction Company building in Dixon, California (about 20 miles west of Sacramento) in the United States, causing about $250,000 worth of damage. There were no casualties in the incident, but the arson, which was caused by an incendiary device planted in the building, destroyed half of the two-story rural warehouse used for livestock auctions.  After the incident, a male caller, identifying himself as a member of the Earth First! group, phoned the Associated Press in San Francisco and claimed responsibility for the incident, stating that the motive for targeting the livestock industry was ""because we are opposed to the livestock industry because it causes irreparable damage to the environment by putting chemicals in food and water and destroying natural habitat for wildlife. We will continue carrying out our actions against the livestock industry in the future until it stops.''","To target the livestock industry was ""because it causes irreparable damage to the environment.""",1,Earth First!,217

"04/03/1989: Members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) claimed responsibility for two arsons at the University of Arizona campus in Tucson, Arizona, causing an estimated $100,000 in damages.  One fire caused damage to the fifth-floor laboratory rooms of the Pharmacy-Microbiology building on the main campus and the second, to a converted residence that housed the office of the Animal Resources Division on the medical campus.  Additionally, in letters sent to news organizations, ALF also claimed responsibility for freeing over 1,000 lab animals from the two facilities as well as a third, also on the campus.  Some of the animals freed included mice infected with  the disease cryptosporidium, which has been known to be fatal in AIDS patients.  No one was injured in the fires, which gutted the laboratories and partially damaged classrooms. The group's statement to the news was that the animals were freed ""from certain torture and death at the hands of U of A students and researchers.""",To protest the use of animals for laboratory testing.,1,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),217

"5/30/1989: Two members of the Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy group, Mark Leslie Davis and Marc Andre Baker, were arrested as they attempted to cut through a metal support tower which held electric lines delivering electricity to the Harcuvar Substation near Wenden, Arizona in the United States.  The two were trying to cut down the power line using a propane torch, similar to their previous incidents of terrorism in 1987 and 1988 at the Flagstaff, Arizona ski lifts and the power lines at the Grand Canyon, Arizona.  The power pole was owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Harcuvar Substation owned by the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which was the main source of water supply for Arizona.  The perpetrators were arrested as they were at the location, about to carry out the attack, and thus, authorities believe much potential damage to the substation was prevented.","The specific motive is unknown; however this group is responsible for multiple incidents of sabotage against power lines and ski equipment; additionally, this particular incident was in preparation for 3 other planned attacks of nuclear facilities, which never came to fruition due to the arrests",1,Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy (EMETIC),217

"08/21/1989: A packaged gas bomb was mailed to the Southeastern regional headquarters office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, causing minor injuries to eight people when it exploded and emitted a white-yellow caustic smoke similar to tear gas.  There was no property damage incurred from the incident.  The perpetrator was later identified to be Walter Moody, who also sent mail bombs which killed  a judge and a civil rights lawyer in December 1989 as well as intercepted bombs and threatening letters, which were signed the ""Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System,"" to other federal courts and NAACP officials . Moody was sentenced to seven life terms plus 400 years in prison without the possibility of parole.","Though the motivations seem to have racial undertones, trial proceedings revealed that Moody had a vendetta against the court system for denying his appeal and upholding his 1972 conviction of possessing pipe bombs; additionally Moody believed blacks received preferential treatment in the courts.",1,Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System,217

"04/28/1990: An explosive device placed in a garbage bin detonated inside a nightclub in New York City, New York, United States. Three people suffered minor injuries. Reports described the device as a homemade pipe bomb and described the target of the attack, Uncle Charlie's Downtown, as a ""well-known gay hangout."" No group claimed responsibility for the attack. Police noted that no threats had been made and there was no evidence that the attack was motivated by bias. However, Mayor David N. Dinkins and many observers were confident that the target itself was indicative of an ideological motive, and noted that anti-bias crime legislation was pending in the State Senate at the time of the attack.",,1,Unknown,217

"06/10/1991: Members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) set fire to storage and research buildings of the experimental mink farm at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon, in the United States, by planting at least six incendiary devices made with clocks, cans of Sterno and 9-volt batteries.  The arson caused a total of $75,000 worth of damage including structural damage to the barn, which was used to store feed, animal bedding and smaller equipment as well as destroyed research documents and records, emptied files, and a broken toilet which caused flooding.  There were no casualties in the incident, which was claimed by the group in a news release sent to the Associated Press in Portland, stating that the farm was targeted ""due to its role in the barbaric fur trade.""  ALF member, Rodney Coronado, who launched ""Operation Bite Back"" in 1991, a five-state arson campaign against the fur industry, was later captured and indicted on federal charges for this incident.  He did not act alone, but the other perpetrators are unknown.  Coronado spent three and a half years in prison for fur industry arsons.",To protest against the fur industry.,1,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),217

"06/15/1991: Members of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) set fire to the Northwest Farm Foods Cooperative, a mink food warehouse, located ten miles north of Seattle at the Edmonds waterfront in Washington, in the United States, causing $500,000 in damage, and a tow truck driver removing vehicles from the scene was treated for smoke inhalation. The group claimed responsibility for the incident in separate news releases to the Associated Press and KIRO in Seattle, in which the group stated that the ""Western Wildlife Cell"" of ALF planted incendiaries in the building in order to cause maximum economic damage ""to an industry that profits from the misery and exploitation of fur animals.""

"12/21/1991: Members of the Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for an arson at a building used to dry mink pelts and prepare mink food at the Malecky Mink Ranch in Yamhill, Oregon, in the United States, which caused $96,000 in damages and led to the permanent retirement of the mink processing plant due to its complete destruction in the fire.  There were no casualties in the incident.  Although an anonymous telephone call was made to KGW-TV, claiming ALF was responsible for the incident, authorities were doubtful of the legitimacy of the call.  Regardless, ALF member Rodney Coronado, who was responsible for several other arsons of fur industry facilities in his Operation Bite Back, was suspected to be linked to this case.",To discourage the raising of animals for the fur trade.,1,Animal Liberation Front (ALF),217
